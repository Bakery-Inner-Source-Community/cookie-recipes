## Preparation and Cooking Time

* **Preparation**: 20 mins
* **Cooking**: 10 mins
* **Effort**: easy

## Ingredients

- 100g unsalted butter, softened at room temperature
- 100g light brown sugar
- 100g caster sugar
- 1 egg, beaten
- 150g self-raising flour
- 2 tbsp cocoa powder
- Â¼ tsp salt
- 200g milk chocolate, 150g chopped into chunks and 50g melted for drizzling
- 75g peanut butter (crunchy or smooth is fine)
- handful of salted peanuts, roughly chopped
- milk to serve, optional

## Method

### Step 1

Heat the oven to 180c/160 fan/gas mark 4 and line two baking trays with parchment. Using
a food mixer or electric whisk beat the butter and sugar together until light
and fluffy. Add in the egg and whisk to combine then beat in the flour, cocoa powder, salt
and chocolate chunks until fully incorporated. Using a spoon swirl the peanut butter
through the cookie dough.

### Step 2

Scoop the dough into 12 large cookies onto the two trays using a dessert spoon, leaving
plenty of room between each cookie as they'll spread. Bake in the oven for 9-10 mins
until still soft and melty in the middle. They will look underbaked but will harden
once cool. Drizzle over the melted milk chocolate and top with a few chopped peanuts and a pinch of
flaky sea salt. Serve with a glass of milk for dunking.

## Recipe Tips

Will keep in an airtight container for up to 3 days but best served on the day of
baking. If cooking for a small group, bake off a portion of the mixture and freeze the
rest, covered, shaped in a log. Cut slices and bake from frozen adding an extra 2 mins
to the cooking time.
